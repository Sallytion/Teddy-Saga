4245479313,Web (FE) Engineer,eBay,,,"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India","At eBay, we're more than a global ecommerce leader — we’re changing the way the world shops and sells. Our platform empowers millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world. We’re committed to pushing boundaries and leaving our mark as we reinvent the future of ecommerce for enthusiasts.

Our customers are our compass, authenticity thrives, bold ideas are welcome, and everyone can bring their unique selves to work — every day. We're in this together, sustaining the future of our customers, our company, and our planet.

Join a team of passionate thinkers, innovators, and dreamers — and help us connect people and build communities to create economic opportunity for all.

Who Are We?

Looking for a company that inspires passion, courage and imagination, where you can be part of the team shaping the future of global commerce? Want to shape how millions of people buy, sell, connect, and share around the world? If you’re interested in joining a purpose driven community that is dedicated to creating an ambitious and inclusive workplace, join eBay – a company you can be proud to be a part of.

The Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Landing Page teams define and build features that optimize the way customers browse our inventory and help them easily find and reach relevant eBay pages when searching on search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. With literally hundreds of millions of products listed on eBay globally at any time, the scale at which eBay has to consider search engine optimization puts our team in a unique position to innovate and provide immediate value to the business.

The SEO Landing Page Platform holds the buyer intent data definition for our category and model landing pages. These pages serve as important destinations for buyers who come from search engines like Google as well as those who are browsing the eBay site. The Linking Services connect those pages and enable them to show up in navigational elements like the breadcrumb and category navigation. The operational tools provide the interface for manual intervention and eventual automation of those operational tasks.

What Will You Do?


Develop and maintain modern, responsive web interfaces for both internal tooling and custom facing applications.
Build reusable React/TypeScript components that can be used in all our experiences.
Ensure SEO best practices are baked into the frontend: semantic HTML, proper meta tags, structured data, and dynamic rendering or server‐side rendering where necessary
Collaborate with UX designers to translate wireframes and mockups into pixel-perfect interfaces, maintaining consistency with the design system
Optimize client-side performance by implementing code-splitting, lazy loading, and efficient state management
Implement accessibility standards (WCAG) to ensure the interfaces are usable by all audiences
Write unit and integration tests (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) to ensure UI stability and prevent regressions
Monitor frontend performance and user experience metrics, set up alerting for runtime errors or slowdowns, and troubleshoot issues to ensure high availability
Create and maintain documentation for component libraries, coding guidelines, and deployment processes



Job Responsibilities


Design, deliver, and maintain significant features within the SEO Platform team, ensuring stable and scalable interfaces
Optimize frontend performance to achieve fast load times, minimal latency, and smooth interactions for end users and crawlers
Come up with a sound technical strategy for component architecture, state management, and styling frameworks (e.g., CSS modules, Tailwind), considering project goals, timelines, and SEO impact
Take point on cross-team efforts—owning the UI problem and ensuring that backend, SEO, and design teams stay in sync toward a cohesive technical solution
Implement and enforce coding standards, accessibility guidelines, and responsive design principles to guarantee consistent user experiences across devices
Maintain thorough documentation covering component library usage, deployment pipelines, and troubleshooting procedures



Minimum Qualifications


Passion and commitment for technical excellence
B.Sc. or M.Sc. in Computer Science or an equivalent professional experience
2+ years of software design and development experience, tackling non-trivial problems in backend services and / or data pipelines
A solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and principles of responsive design and performance optimization
Production-grade coding experience with React (or another modern frontend framework) and TypeScript/JavaScript
Familiarity with writing unit and integration tests for frontend applications (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library)
Experience with build tools and automated CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Webpack, Babel)
Knowledge of accessibility standards (WCAG) and SEO best practices for frontend development
Excellent verbal and written communication and collaboration skills

4295774789,Software Development Engineer (SDE),LimeChat,,,"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India","About LimeChat

At LimeChat, we’re on a mission to revolutionize conversational commerce by enabling human‑level interactions on WhatsApp. Backed by top‑tier investors such as Stellaris, Titan, Pi Ventures and part of Y Combinator W21, we already power 500+ leading brands—including Mahindra, HUL, ITC, and Mamaearth.




Our next frontier: enterprise verticals like BFSI, Health, Auto, and Retail. We’re shipping cutting‑edge GenAI agents that automate and personalise millions of customer journeys every single day.

Our founders are Computer Science alumni from IIT Delhi with a specialization in AI and have been recognized as Forbes 30 Under 30 honorees for their groundbreaking work. Their vision and leadership drive us to build the best products in the industry.




We’re a tight‑knit crew that moves fast, sweats the details, and owns outcomes. If that sounds like your vibe, you’ll feel right at home.




Some Quotes We Live By

“It’s okay to fail. It’s not okay to not try.”
“Do the right thing when others are not looking.”




What are we looking for?

We're seeking a skilled Software Development Engineer who excels in creating seamless connections between various systems and applications. If you're passionate about coding, love solving integration challenges, and enjoy working with APIs, you might be the ideal candidate.

In this role, you'll collaborate closely with our development and product teams to design and implement robust integration solutions. Your work will ensure that different systems communicate effectively, creating a cohesive and efficient technology ecosystem. Join us to build integration solutions that enhance our technical capabilities and drive business success.




Responsibilities

Own client go‑lives: Translate enterprise requirements into working GenAI deployments—scoping, coding, testing, and shipping on aggressive timelines.
Build custom integrations: Craft REST/webhook connectors, event pipelines, and data syncs that plug our agents into CRMs, OMS, ERPs, and bespoke systems.
Engineer GenAI workflows: Orchestrate RAG pipelines, prompt chains, and fine‑tuning jobs, using tools like LangChain and PGVector.
Design deployment architectures: Spin up scalable, secure clusters on AWS/GCP with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform/Helm.
Instrument & optimise: Track latency, token spend, and error budgets; debug across logs (Kibana), tracing, and databases to keep uptime > 99.9 %.
Create playbooks: Document repeatable patterns, SDKs, and IaC modules so future deployments are faster and safer.
Partner cross‑functionally: Work with Customer Success, Product, and Core Engineering to shape roadmap and close feedback loops.




Must-haves

1–3 years building backend/integration solutions for SaaS or platform products.
Proficient in Python or Node.js (FastAPI/Django/Express) and strong in RESTful API design.
Solid database chops—SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB/Redis); comfortable writing performant queries and schema migrations.
Hands‑on with Docker containers, Kubernetes/ECS, and at least one cloud provider (AWS or GCP).
Experience with Git, code‑reviews, and CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions).
Debugging ninja: can trace requests across services, logs, and message queues to isolate bottlenecks quickly.
Excellent written & verbal communication—able to simplify complex tech for clients and teammates.




Nice‑to‑have

Familiarity with LLM/GenAI tooling (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack) and vector stores (PGVector, Pinecone).
Event‑driven architecture experience (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SNS/SQS).
Infra‑as‑Code with Terraform or Pulumi; observability stacks (Grafana, Prometheus).
Security & compliance basics (SOC 2, ISO 27001) and secrets management (Vault, AWS KMS).




TechStack @ LimeChat

Python • Node.js • FastAPI/Django • PostgreSQL • MongoDB • Redis • RabbitMQ • Docker • Kubernetes • AWS/GCP • Terraform • LangChain • PGVector




Growth Path

Year 1: Launch 10+ enterprise deployments, build reusable integration SDKs, reduce average go‑live from 4 weeks → 1 week.
Year 2+: Lead a Deployment squad, shape platform extensibility, or transition into Product/Platform Engineering.




Perks & Benefits

Unlimited PTO & sick leave
Subsidised fitness membership
Free lunch & snacks
Annual company retreat
Pet‑friendly office 🐾
