Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.

In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.

About The Role

As an Early Career Software Engineer at Notion, you’ll help shape core user experiences and accelerate how people discover value in Notion. You'll tackle meaningful challenges with increasing autonomy, crafting code that millions of users will experience. You'll take ownership of projects that matter, make critical technical decisions, and contribute your unique perspective to our product vision. Working alongside passionate experts across design, product, and data, you'll help shape the future of how people work.

We’re hiring early career engineers to join us across several teams at Notion. Your recruiter will partner with you to find the team that best aligns with your interests and where you can make the highest impact.

What You’ll Achieve


Plan, build, and ship product features from conception to launch, then iterate based on insights and user feedback.
Improve performance, reliability, and quality of key experiences used by millions of users and thousands of organizations.
Run experiments that drive activation, retention, collaboration, and revenue, partnering with design, data science, and research.
Build internal tools and platform improvements that help all engineers ship quickly and safely.
Contribute to team norms, code quality, and a culture of learning and thoughtful tradeoffs.


Areas you might work on


Core Notion product features: Help develop, improve, and maintain features for our flagship product, focusing on the editor, databases, sharing, or other key areas that power millions of workflows.
AI and automation: Help develop and integrate intelligent features that make Notion more powerful, contextual, and efficient for our users.
Growth and activation: Work on features that help new users discover Notion's value, improve onboarding experiences, and increase user engagement.
Platform and infrastructure: Contribute to the systems that power Notion's backend services, ensuring reliability, scalability, and performance as our user base grows.


Skills You’ll Bring


Proven track record of execution: You have a minimum of 1 year (and up to 3 years) of full-time professional engineering experience, including building world-class product experiences as part of an engineering team. You have solid fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems, with a product-minded, pragmatic approach to solving problems.
Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity successfully, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
Impact-driven approach to technology: You see technologies as tools to achieve user impact rather than ends in themselves. You care more about building successful systems that solve real problems than about using specific tech stacks or following trends. You stay current with the latest tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and other AI-assisted development environments, you're pragmatic about choosing the right tool for the job, focusing on what delivers the most value to users and the business.
Proactive communication and high agency: You own your work, communicating clearly about progress and blockers. You don't wait for instructions for every step but rather show initiative in identifying what needs to be done and driving projects forward. You ask questions when needed while independently finding solutions to problems.


Nice to Have


Experience with parts of our stack like React, TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres, or with experimentation and analytics tooling.
Exposure to distributed systems, observability, CI/CD, or infrastructure fundamentals.
An interest in product quality and craft, and in helping others stay in flow.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

4299178327,Analyst - Python Engineer,BlackRock,,,"Wilmington, DE","Responsibilities

About this role

Developers are expected to be involved from inception of projects, understand requirements, architect, develop, deploy, and maintain applications. Typically they work in a multi-disciplinary squad (we follow Agile!) which involves partnering with program and product managers to expand product offering based on business demands. Design is an iterative process, whether for UX, services or infrastructure. Our goal is to drive up user engagement and adoption of the platform while constantly working towards modernizing and improving platform performance and scalability.

Deployment and maintenance requires close interaction with various teams. This requires maintaining a positive and collaborative working relationship with teams within Aladdin Data as well as with wider Aladdin developer community. Production support for applications is usually required for issues that cannot be resolved by operations team. Creative and inventive problem solving skills for reduced turn around times are highly valued.

Preparing user documentation to maintain both development and operations continuity is integral to the role. Adhering to BlackRock's software and design standards is expected and contributing towards upkeep of those standards is encouraged.

Python Engineer - Infrastructure Focused

Remote

Contract; through end of January 2026, potential to extend

Rate: $60-90/hr W2 + benefits




We’re looking for a senior-level Python engineer with deep experience building and stabilizing infrastructure-focused microservices. This role is all about refactoring, testing, and improving reliability in existing codebases that integrate with storage APIs, Redis queues, and Postgres databases. It’s not a greenfield application development role — success here means diagnosing issues quickly, strengthening service resilience, and delivering production-quality fixes in a complex environment.




What You’ll Work On:

Refactor and stabilize mid-life-cycle services, ensuring performance and reliability.
Build and maintain REST APIs and microservices using Python (Flask, FastAPI, or similar).
Develop automated test pipelines with pytest and CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Vela, etc.).
Work with distributed systems (Redis queues, retries, idempotency, failover handling).
Manage and optimize Postgres + SQLAlchemy ORM data layers.
Deploy with Docker; exposure to Kubernetes/TAP is a plus.




Nice to Have:

Experience with enterprise storage systems (NetApp ONTAP, Ceph, StorageGrid).
Familiarity with hybrid cloud storage APIs (AWS EBS/EFS, GCP Filestore, Azure equivalents).
Observability skills (structured logging, metrics, monitoring).
Experience validating high-availability systems with health checks, canary validation, or service alerting.




Benefits:

York Solutions Offers a generous benefits package for eligible full-time employees:

BCBS Medical with 3 Plans to choose from (PPO and High deductible PPO plans with Health Savings Program)
Delta Dental plan with 2 free cleanings and insurance discounts
Eye Med Vision with annual check-ups and discounts on lens
Life and Accidental Death Insurance paid by company
John Hancock 401(k) Retirement Plan with discretionary company match
Voluntary Insurance programs such as: Hospital Indemnity, Identity Protection, Legal Insurance, Long Term Care, and Pet Insurance.
Flexible work environment with some remote working opportunities
Strong fun and teamwork environment
Learning, development, and career growth

Exposure to Infrastructure‑as‑Code (e.g., Terraform), container orchestration, or service meshes.
Hands‑on with observability stacks (e.g., Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Grafana).


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

4276096791,"Software Engineer, Developer Experience",Notion,,,"San Francisco, CA","About Us

Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.

In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.

About The Role

Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. The Developer Experience team is responsible for architecting, implementing, and scaling the tools and frameworks that Notion developers use to build Notion. We are looking for engineers who are passionate about solving engineering productivity challenges, have deep empathy for other developers, and love to communicate with engineers. You don't need to have experience in this domain but willing to advocate for developer experience is the key.

What You'll Achieve


Collaborate with engineers across the company to deliver an industry-leading developer experience, along the way working deeply with tools like the TypeScript language server, lint tooling, and the Notion CLI to improve developers’ day to day experience.
Work on the bleeding edge of tooling performance, researching and evaluating new tools and keeping up with new developments in the developer experience space in the JS ecosystem.
Work deeply with GitHub and our CI systems to help ensure engineers can merge their code quickly and safely. We aim for all PR CI pipelines to finish within 15 minutes!
Take ownership of our development environment and toolchain, and contribute to novel projects across the company to deliver impact.


Skills You'll Need To Bring


A drive to make developers’ lives better: you have a strong interest in keeping engineers in their flow state through better tooling. You like to think critically about the workflows engineers use in their day to day work, finding bottlenecks and thinking outside of the box to find ways to pave a better golden path for engineers to follow.
A focus on user experience: you bring care and craft to the user experience you build into your products. Your work emphasizes simplicity, supportability, and ease-of-use, and you communicate clearly with other teams and engineers to get feedback on where we can improve.
Multitasker and present: you like interrupts especially if this is blocking engineers.You switch between your project work and day to day developer experience challenges.
Interest in learning how things work: you love to learn how the tools you use work at a fundamental level. You get excited at the idea of digging into third-party source code to understand how they work and find new ways to use them.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.


Nice To Haves


Familiarity with TypeScript, especially in ways to keep it running smoothly in a large codebase.
An interest in automated testing and familiarity with testing best practices
Past experience with React and common tooling like React Testing Library
Past experience on developer experience teams or related tools


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Privacy Statement




All member records are protected according to our Privacy Policy. Further, while employees of Headspace (formerly Ginger) cannot access Headspace products/services, they will be offered benefits according to the company's benefit plan. To ensure we are adhering to best practice and ethical guidelines in the field of mental health, we take care to avoid dual relationships. A dual relationship occurs when a mental health care provider has a second, significantly different relationship with their client in addition to the traditional client-therapist relationship—including, for example, a managerial relationship.  




As such, Headspace requests that individuals who have received coaching or clinical services at Headspace wait until their care with Headspace is complete before applying for a position. If someone with a Headspace account is hired for a position, please note their account will be deactivated and they will not be able to use Headspace services for the duration of their employment. 




Further, if Headspace cannot find a role that fails to resolve an ethical issue associated with a dual relationship, Headspace may need to take steps to ensure ethical obligations are being adhered to, including a delayed start date or a potential leave of absence. Such steps would be taken to protect both the former member, as well as any relevant individuals from their care team, from impairment, risk of exploitation, or harm.

If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.

4297632288,"Software Engineer, Teamwork",Notion,,,"San Francisco, CA","About Us

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Teamwork's mission is to make Notion the best collaborative environment for knowledge work. To that end, our ambitious goal is to transform Notion into the first of its kind—a shared experience where teams, people, and AI create their life's work, together. Our team focuses on improving our users' most frequent interactions within the Notion app: navigating their workspace, discovering relevant information, and working together effectively. We maintain and iterate on key building blocks of the collaboration experience, including the sidebar, inbox, notification and digest emails, comments, home page, and more.

We are at a unique and exciting turning point in Notion's journey, with two foundational shifts in customer needs. On one hand, we are witnessing unprecedented growth in the scale and complexity of our users' content and collaboration requirements. On the other, we are reimagining from the ground up our users' workflows in the AI era. To address these challenges, we are taking a step back to rethink Notion's core information architecture and develop a new foundation that will support our users' needs for the next decade.

We are looking for passionate full stack product engineers to help us build this vision. In this role, you will directly contribute to core building blocks of Notion's user experience, and will be a key player in building a robust technical foundation that can scale to individual users and large organizations alike.

What You'll Achieve


You'll lead strategic projects that improve Notion’s core user experience. You will work with cross-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to develop a product and technical vision that makes software toolmaking intuitive and scalable for all. You will drive execution on the team to deliver high-quality features to our users.
You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more.
You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales elegantly across many dimensions.

Skills You'll Need To Bring


Proven track record of execution: You have 7+ years of engineering experience, including several years building world-class product experiences alongside a team of engineers.
Tech leadership experience: You have previously held positions where you were responsible for making key technical decisions, guiding a team through complex projects, and mentoring junior team members.
Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.

          <strong>About Us<br><br></strong>We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.<br><br>We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.<br><br>Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).<br><br><strong>About The Role<br><br></strong>Teamwork's mission is to make Notion the best collaborative environment for knowledge work.

On the other, we are reimagining from the ground up our users' workflows in the AI era. To address these challenges, we are taking a step back to rethink Notion's core information architecture and develop a new foundation that will support our users' needs for the next decade.<br><br>We are looking for passionate full stack product engineers to help us build this vision.

4168110099,Fullstack Software Engineer,Hadrian,,,"Los Angeles, CA","Hadrian — Manufacturing the Future

Hadrian is building autonomous factories that help aerospace and defense companies manufacture rockets, satellites, jets, and ships up to 10x faster and up to 2x cheaper. By combining advanced software, robotics, and full-stack manufacturing, we are reinventing how America produces its most critical parts.

We recently raised $260 million dollar Series C to accelerate this mission. We are excited to be launching a new Factory in Mesa, Arizona, a 270,000 square foot facility that will create 350 new jobs immediately. We are opening a new headquarters to support thousands of future hires, launching Hadrian Maritime to serve naval production, and introducing a Factory-as-a-Service model that delivers complete systems instead of individual parts.

Hadrian works with startups, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, and major defense contractors across space, shipbuilding, and aviation to scale production, reduce costs, and accelerate delivery on mission-critical programs. We are backed by leading investors including Lux Capital, Founders Fund, and Andreessen Horowitz. Our fast-growing team is united by a shared mission to reindustrialize American manufacturing for the 21st century and beyond!

The Role

As a foundational member of our software engineering team, you'll work closely with our product, operations, data, and robotics teams to make Flow, our FactoryOS, the factory platform of the future.

Flow is composed of a variety of internal and external critical business applications. Internally, we build software that informs, augments, and replaces work that needs to be done in the factory — for example, taking a customer request for parts, analyzing the complexity and cost, load balancing the work based on factory capacity, and returning a dynamic price quote and delivery estimate. Externally, our software helps our customers interface with Hadrian and manage their supply chain in real time.

Note: You do not need to have aerospace, defense, or manufacturing experience to excel in this role

What You'll Do


Scope, architect, implement, and deploy critical applications that will drive revenue and make a positive impact in the world
Own a product vertical with the opportunity to build a team around yourself over time (if interested)
Work directly with our internal and external customers to drive our roadmap
Get to build alongside an incredible team of engineers, operators, and the best machinists/CAM programmers in the world
Be given autonomy and virtually unlimited room to grow


What We’re Looking For


Bias to action, take pride in your work, and care more about getting to the right solution than being right
Have tech-lead critical projects or initiatives
Have worked on large, complex codebases
Have extensive experience shipping modern, full-stack applications (our front-ends are React/Next/Typescript and back-ends are Go and Python)
Are product-minded and user-driven
Are excited to work in a fast-paced environment with high-stakes and quick iteration cycles
Are a previous or future founder — if you leave Hadrian to start a company we'll do everything to support you, including investing in you and introducing you to Hadrian's investors
Can work from our Los Angeles Factory (Torrance)


Compensation

For this role, the target salary range is $120,000 - $250,000 (actual range may vary based on experience).

This is the lowest to highest salary we reasonably and in good faith believe we would pay for this role at the time of this posting. We may ultimately pay more or less than the posted range, and the range may be modified in the future. An employee's pay position within the salary range will be based on several factors, including, but not limited to, relevant education, qualifications, certifications, experience, skills, geographic location, performance, and business or organizational needs.

Benefits


100% coverage of medical, dental, vision, and life insurance plans for employees
401k
Relocation stipend if you’re moving from outside of LA
Flexible vacation policy

4297551296,"Software Developer, Services",Slice,,,"New York, United States","Ilir Sela started Slice with the belief that local pizzerias deserve all of the advantages of major franchises without compromising their independence. Starting with his family’s pizzerias, we now empower over tens of thousands of restaurants with the technology, services, and collective power that owners need to better serve their digitally minded customers and build lasting businesses. We’re growing and adding more talent to help fulfil this valuable mission. That’s where you come in.

This position is open to applicants based in the US and located in an Eastern time zone.

The Challenge to Solve

How do mom-and-pop pizzerias survive and win in a world of big-budget pizza chains and third-party apps? This is the challenge you’ll help solve at Slice. Local pizzerias already outperform the big chains in offline sales, yet are outsold 20-to-1 online – a gap we’re determined to close. We operate at the intersection of high stakes and local community: our mission is to level the playing field for small businesses by providing them with the technology and capabilities that rival those of the biggest players. When a shop partners with Slice, our goal is that it feels “as if they’ve just hired 1,000 people” to support their business. As an engineer on our team, you’ll seek out bold, asymmetric opportunities to create these outsized impacts for our restaurant partners and the millions of customers they serve. It’s not just about writing code – it’s about writing the future of local pizza.

What You'll Do

As a Software Developer on our Services team, you will immerse yourself in our ambitious mission and take on a wide range of responsibilities to drive customer impact. Specifically, you will:


Build innovative features & services: Design, code, and launch new backend features that help our restaurant partners operate more efficiently and deliver exceptional, seamless experiences to their customers. Your work will directly enhance real-world interactions between shops and pizza lovers every day.
Identify game-changing opportunities: Constantly look for asymmetric opportunities where a small technical change can deliver disproportionate value. You’ll use your creativity and entrepreneurial mindset to find 10x solutions that delight users and give our partners an edge.
Own projects end-to-end: Take ownership of initiatives from concept through production. You’ll work closely with product, design, and other teams to define solutions, execute rapidly, and iterate based on feedback. When you see a problem, you don’t wait - you tackle it.
Use the best tools for the job: While our primary stack is Python (Flask), we embrace any technology that delivers value. You might rewrite a microservice from Go to Python, craft a script in Ruby, or leverage a new cloud service – whatever it takes to solve the task at hand in a scalable way.
Collaborate in a small, agile team: Work alongside a tight-knit team of 5 to 8 backend engineers (across the US, UK, and Europe) who are as passionate about the mission as you are. Together, you will review code, brainstorm ideas, and push each other to raise the bar while maintaining a fun, supportive atmosphere.
Ensure quality and performance at scale: Employ best practices in coding, testing, monitoring, and DevOps to ensure our services are reliable and performant. You build it, you own it - from writing unit tests to fine-tuning logging and alerting, you’ll make sure your code runs smoothly in production.


The Winning Recipe

We’re Looking For Bold, Founder-like Engineers Who Aren’t Afraid To Challenge The Status Quo And Build Products That Make a Real Difference. If You’re An Unconventional Thinker And a Highly Productive Doer, You’ll Feel Right At Home. The Ideal Candidate Has


Owner’s mindset: You think like a founder. You take initiative, own problems end-to-end, and move with urgency to deliver results. Obstacles energize you, and you thrive in a fast-paced, ambiguous startup environment where your decisions drive real impact.
Proven builder: You have solid experience crafting scalable backend systems in Python (Flask) and working with databases and cloud services. You’re comfortable diving into monitoring and logging tools to keep systems healthy. More importantly, you’re technology-agnostic – you quickly pick up new languages or frameworks (Go, Ruby, or whatever is needed) to solve problems effectively.
Remote-ready collaborator: You excel at working on a distributed team and communicating asynchronously. You’re comfortable collaborating with teammates across different time zones and backgrounds, and you know how to stay connected and communicative in a remote work setting.
Product & customer focus: You care deeply about the why behind your code. You can clearly express opinions on product direction and design, always keeping the end-customer and restaurant owner in mind. At the same time, you respect others’ perspectives and believe the best ideas can come from anywhere.
Innovative problem solver: You love finding creative solutions to hard problems. Words like “impossible” or “uncharted” fuel your curiosity. You seek out those asymmetric win scenarios and aren’t afraid to experiment, adapt, and iterate to achieve a better outcome for users.


If you’ve ever dreamed of building something big, scrappy, and impactful – and you have the skills to back it up – we want to meet you!

4298953089,"Full Stack Engineer, Connect",Meter,,,"San Francisco, CA","Meter builds the infrastructure modern businesses depend on to stay connected. Our product, Connect, helps companies source, compare, install and manage internet connectivity across thousands of locations. We turn what is usually a painful process into one that is fast, transparent, and surprisingly simple.

We are hiring a Full Stack Engineer to drive the technical vision and development of the Connect platform. This role is not just about building features; it’s about solving complex problems at scale. Your work will improve customer experience, reduce friction, and enable Meter to scale to serve thousands of customers and tens of thousands of connections across the globe.

What Success Looks Like

You will build our Connect platform that empowers our customers to seamlessly manage their internet service provider connections from initial serviceability and quotation to support and billing and everything in between. More specifically, you’ll work to evaluate and integrate a variety of third party APIs, display abstract data in a seamless fashion for both customers and internal stakeholders, and build and develop automation to drive efficiency in a highly inefficient industry.

What Your Day-to-day Will Look Like

You’ll collaborate closely with our frontend, backend, and internal operations teammates to ship full-featured, production-grade systems that directly impact how businesses manage their connectivity. On the backend you will build in Go with Postgres, maintaining and extending our GraphQL API, and deploying on AWS and Azure. On the frontend, you will develop both customer-facing UIs and internal tools using React and TypeScript.

Who You Are

We are searching for someone who wants to do the most ambitious work of their career. You are a good fit if you are comfortable working across the stack, you thrive in an experimental environment where speed and quality matter a great deal, and you take ownership and drive technical decisions.

Why Meter?

The internet runs the world. Every purchase you make, video call you join, it's all packets flowing through networks. But those networks haven’t changed for decades. They’re brittle, complex, and surprisingly hard to set up in an enterprise space.

We started Meter to build better networks. We had to build everything from the ground-up: designing and building our own enterprise hardware, intuitive software, and streamlined operations to deliver great outcomes for our customers. Today, we build and deploy these networks at scale. Ambitious companies and enduring institutions like Bridgewater, Lyft, Reddit, rely on Meter to keep their thousands of employees and locations online and productive.

Our bet with Meter is simple: we will all use the internet more than we do today. We believe we have the definitive networking stack in place to enable business to do so as seamlessly and reliably as any modern utility.

Compensation


The estimated base salary for this role is between $170,000 - $220,000
Additionally, this role is eligible to participate in Meter's equity plan.

4298246412,Machine Learning Engineer,Nearmap,,,"Carlsbad, CA","The sky's not the limit at Nearmap



We’re a SaaS company, with proprietary hardware and software that’s continuously advancing through our commitment to innovation. The sky’s the limit when it comes to what we can and plan to do for our customers. Our imagery is just the starting point. Our impact comes from our people, applying complex analysis, interpretation and artificial intelligence that opens up all sorts of possibilities for our customers.





Job Description



The Insurance AI team conducts technical work to design, develop, and support products that use Nearmap and third-party data to derive insurance risk insights. While our data scientists focus on modeling and analysis, the Machine Learning Engineer ensures they have the robust, scalable, and efficient tools, pipelines, and development environments they need to deliver.



In this role, you will:



Act as the Insurance AI team’s champion for code and tool reuse (python), ensuring models move smoothly from concept to reliable operation in production, and helping the team leverage “Nearmap scale” data effectively to build and deploy the best models.
Design and build data and model pipelines that enable the full lifecycle of model development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.
Adapt, extend, and productionize tooling from the broader AI & Computer Vision (AICV) team in Sydney to meet the specific needs of the Insurance AI team.
Operate within cloud-based infrastructure, making use of internal and external APIs, bucket storage, databases, cloud compute and other technologies to integrate data, models, and workflows into scalable production systems.
Ensure our infrastructure and processes support experimentation at speed while maintaining high standards for reliability, security, and scalability.

While prior experience in insurance or deep learning on aerial imagery is not required, familiarity in these areas will be considered a plus.



Key Responsibilities:



ML Engineering & Infrastructure Development
Contribute to ML pipelines on cloud native technologies for data ingestion, feature processing, model training, deployment, and monitoring in AWS.
Support internal tools and frameworks to streamline experimentation, ensure reproducibility, and improve delivery speed.

2. API Integration & Tooling Adaptation



Develop, consume, and integrate both internal and external APIs to connect datasets, models, and services in collaboration with other engineers.
Adapt and extend core tooling from the AI & Computer Vision team for Insurance AI’s specific use cases.
Bridge the gap between research prototypes and production-grade systems.

3. Collaboration & Technical Leadership



Serve as a trusted technical partner to data scientists, enabling them to execute modeling projects efficiently and at scale.

2+ years of experience as a Machine Learning Engineer, ML-focused Software Engineer, or equivalent, with a proven record of delivering production-grade ML systems.
Bachelors degree in math, computer science or other related technical field.
Experience integrating and adapting existing ML tools to new domains or use cases.

Mandatory:



Python-based Machine Learning: Using a range of python packages for ML pipeline development and deployment (such as sklearn, pandas, PyTorch).
Software Development: ability to code in Python, with strong skills in writing clean, maintainable, well tested and efficient code, working with other engineers on a shared codebase. You will need to make use of a range of python packages built by other teams, and work collaboratively through feature branch and pull request reviews.
Data Engineering: Proficiency with SQL and experience building scalable data processing workflows (e.g., Apache Spark, Airflow, dbt).
Collaboration: Strong communication skills and ability to translate technical solutions into actionable steps for non-engineers (working with a range of Data Scientists, ML Engineers and ML Ops engineers)

About Wealthfront




Here at Wealthfront, our mission is to create a financial system that favors people, not institutions. We do this by leveraging technology to build powerful, low-cost, and easy-to-use financial products that help modern investors grow and manage their money.




We started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business. By automating strategies typically reserved for the wealthy, we unlocked access to high quality investment advice for a digitally-native generation that was underserved by traditional institutions. Since then, we've expanded to a full suite of products designed to help our clients turn their savings into long-term wealth, including:




• A Cash Account that, through our partner banks, offers one of the highest annual percentage yields on uninvested cash in the industry, while providing instant and secure access to your money with no account fees and a full suite of checking features.




• A zero-commission Stock Investing Account with 50+ handpicked collections that help DIY investors discover new companies and make smarter investing decisions.




• Multiple automated investing portfolios designed to unlock tax savings through sophisticated strategies like fixed income, tax-loss harvesting, and direct indexing—which we offer at industry-leading low costs and accessible minimums.




Our award-winning products have attracted over 1 million clients who trust us with more than $85 billion of their hard earned savings—and we're far from done. If you’re inspired to help us reshape the financial industry as we create our next chapter, let’s talk!

Message to applicants applying to work in the U.S. and/or Canada:

When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. and/or Canada locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.

U.S. employees haveaccess (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/careers/we-are-cisco/benefits-and-perks.html) to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings.

Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday (for non-exempt employees), plus a day off for their birthday. Non-Exempt new hires accrue up to 16 days of vacation time off each year, at a rate of 4.92 hours per pay period. Exempt new hires participate in Cisco’s flexible Vacation Time Off policy, which does not place a defined limit on how much vacation time eligible employees may use, but is subject to availability and some business limitations. All new hires are eligible for Sick Time Off subject to Cisco’s Sick Time Off Policy and will have eighty (80) hours of sick time off provided on their hire date and on January 1st of each year thereafter. Up to 80 hours of unused sick time will be carried forward from one calendar year to the next such that the maximum number of sick time hours an employee may have available is 160 hours. Employees in Illinois have a unique time off program designed specifically with local requirements in mind. All employees also have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.

Employees On Sales Plans Earn Performance-based Incentive Pay On Top Of Their Base Salary, Which Is Split Between Quota And Non-quota Components. For Quota-based Incentive Pay, Cisco Typically Pays As Follows


75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;


1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;

1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.

For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.
