Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.

In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.

About The Role

As an Early Career Software Engineer at Notion, you’ll help shape core user experiences and accelerate how people discover value in Notion. You'll tackle meaningful challenges with increasing autonomy, crafting code that millions of users will experience. You'll take ownership of projects that matter, make critical technical decisions, and contribute your unique perspective to our product vision. Working alongside passionate experts across design, product, and data, you'll help shape the future of how people work.

We’re hiring early career engineers to join us across several teams at Notion. Your recruiter will partner with you to find the team that best aligns with your interests and where you can make the highest impact.

What You’ll Achieve


Plan, build, and ship product features from conception to launch, then iterate based on insights and user feedback.
Improve performance, reliability, and quality of key experiences used by millions of users and thousands of organizations.
Run experiments that drive activation, retention, collaboration, and revenue, partnering with design, data science, and research.
Build internal tools and platform improvements that help all engineers ship quickly and safely.
Contribute to team norms, code quality, and a culture of learning and thoughtful tradeoffs.


Areas you might work on


Core Notion product features: Help develop, improve, and maintain features for our flagship product, focusing on the editor, databases, sharing, or other key areas that power millions of workflows.
AI and automation: Help develop and integrate intelligent features that make Notion more powerful, contextual, and efficient for our users.
Growth and activation: Work on features that help new users discover Notion's value, improve onboarding experiences, and increase user engagement.
Platform and infrastructure: Contribute to the systems that power Notion's backend services, ensuring reliability, scalability, and performance as our user base grows.


Skills You’ll Bring


Proven track record of execution: You have a minimum of 1 year (and up to 3 years) of full-time professional engineering experience, including building world-class product experiences as part of an engineering team. You have solid fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems, with a product-minded, pragmatic approach to solving problems.
Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity successfully, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
Impact-driven approach to technology: You see technologies as tools to achieve user impact rather than ends in themselves. You care more about building successful systems that solve real problems than about using specific tech stacks or following trends. You stay current with the latest tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and other AI-assisted development environments, you're pragmatic about choosing the right tool for the job, focusing on what delivers the most value to users and the business.
Proactive communication and high agency: You own your work, communicating clearly about progress and blockers. You don't wait for instructions for every step but rather show initiative in identifying what needs to be done and driving projects forward. You ask questions when needed while independently finding solutions to problems.


Nice to Have


Experience with parts of our stack like React, TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres, or with experimentation and analytics tooling.
Exposure to distributed systems, observability, CI/CD, or infrastructure fundamentals.
An interest in product quality and craft, and in helping others stay in flow.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

4299178327,Analyst - Python Engineer,BlackRock,,,"Wilmington, DE","Responsibilities

About this role

Developers are expected to be involved from inception of projects, understand requirements, architect, develop, deploy, and maintain applications. Typically they work in a multi-disciplinary squad (we follow Agile!) which involves partnering with program and product managers to expand product offering based on business demands. Design is an iterative process, whether for UX, services or infrastructure. Our goal is to drive up user engagement and adoption of the platform while constantly working towards modernizing and improving platform performance and scalability.

Deployment and maintenance requires close interaction with various teams. This requires maintaining a positive and collaborative working relationship with teams within Aladdin Data as well as with wider Aladdin developer community. Production support for applications is usually required for issues that cannot be resolved by operations team. Creative and inventive problem solving skills for reduced turn around times are highly valued.

Preparing user documentation to maintain both development and operations continuity is integral to the role. Adhering to BlackRock's software and design standards is expected and contributing towards upkeep of those standards is encouraged.

Python Engineer - Infrastructure Focused

Remote

Contract; through end of January 2026, potential to extend

Rate: $60-90/hr W2 + benefits




We’re looking for a senior-level Python engineer with deep experience building and stabilizing infrastructure-focused microservices. This role is all about refactoring, testing, and improving reliability in existing codebases that integrate with storage APIs, Redis queues, and Postgres databases. It’s not a greenfield application development role — success here means diagnosing issues quickly, strengthening service resilience, and delivering production-quality fixes in a complex environment.




What You’ll Work On:

Refactor and stabilize mid-life-cycle services, ensuring performance and reliability.
Build and maintain REST APIs and microservices using Python (Flask, FastAPI, or similar).
Develop automated test pipelines with pytest and CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Vela, etc.).
Work with distributed systems (Redis queues, retries, idempotency, failover handling).
Manage and optimize Postgres + SQLAlchemy ORM data layers.
Deploy with Docker; exposure to Kubernetes/TAP is a plus.




Nice to Have:

Experience with enterprise storage systems (NetApp ONTAP, Ceph, StorageGrid).
Familiarity with hybrid cloud storage APIs (AWS EBS/EFS, GCP Filestore, Azure equivalents).
Observability skills (structured logging, metrics, monitoring).
Experience validating high-availability systems with health checks, canary validation, or service alerting.




Benefits:

York Solutions Offers a generous benefits package for eligible full-time employees:

BCBS Medical with 3 Plans to choose from (PPO and High deductible PPO plans with Health Savings Program)
Delta Dental plan with 2 free cleanings and insurance discounts
Eye Med Vision with annual check-ups and discounts on lens
Life and Accidental Death Insurance paid by company
John Hancock 401(k) Retirement Plan with discretionary company match
Voluntary Insurance programs such as: Hospital Indemnity, Identity Protection, Legal Insurance, Long Term Care, and Pet Insurance.
Flexible work environment with some remote working opportunities
Strong fun and teamwork environment
Learning, development, and career growth

Exposure to Infrastructure‑as‑Code (e.g., Terraform), container orchestration, or service meshes.
Hands‑on with observability stacks (e.g., Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Grafana).


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

4276096791,"Software Engineer, Developer Experience",Notion,,,"San Francisco, CA","About Us

Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.

In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.

About The Role

Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. The Developer Experience team is responsible for architecting, implementing, and scaling the tools and frameworks that Notion developers use to build Notion. We are looking for engineers who are passionate about solving engineering productivity challenges, have deep empathy for other developers, and love to communicate with engineers. You don't need to have experience in this domain but willing to advocate for developer experience is the key.

What You'll Achieve


Collaborate with engineers across the company to deliver an industry-leading developer experience, along the way working deeply with tools like the TypeScript language server, lint tooling, and the Notion CLI to improve developers’ day to day experience.
Work on the bleeding edge of tooling performance, researching and evaluating new tools and keeping up with new developments in the developer experience space in the JS ecosystem.
Work deeply with GitHub and our CI systems to help ensure engineers can merge their code quickly and safely. We aim for all PR CI pipelines to finish within 15 minutes!
Take ownership of our development environment and toolchain, and contribute to novel projects across the company to deliver impact.


Skills You'll Need To Bring


A drive to make developers’ lives better: you have a strong interest in keeping engineers in their flow state through better tooling. You like to think critically about the workflows engineers use in their day to day work, finding bottlenecks and thinking outside of the box to find ways to pave a better golden path for engineers to follow.
A focus on user experience: you bring care and craft to the user experience you build into your products. Your work emphasizes simplicity, supportability, and ease-of-use, and you communicate clearly with other teams and engineers to get feedback on where we can improve.
Multitasker and present: you like interrupts especially if this is blocking engineers.You switch between your project work and day to day developer experience challenges.
Interest in learning how things work: you love to learn how the tools you use work at a fundamental level. You get excited at the idea of digging into third-party source code to understand how they work and find new ways to use them.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.


Nice To Haves


Familiarity with TypeScript, especially in ways to keep it running smoothly in a large codebase.
An interest in automated testing and familiarity with testing best practices
Past experience with React and common tooling like React Testing Library
Past experience on developer experience teams or related tools


We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

We respect the laws enforced by the EEOC and are dedicated to going above and beyond in fostering diversity across our workplace.

Privacy Statement




All member records are protected according to our Privacy Policy. Further, while employees of Headspace (formerly Ginger) cannot access Headspace products/services, they will be offered benefits according to the company's benefit plan. To ensure we are adhering to best practice and ethical guidelines in the field of mental health, we take care to avoid dual relationships. A dual relationship occurs when a mental health care provider has a second, significantly different relationship with their client in addition to the traditional client-therapist relationship—including, for example, a managerial relationship.  




As such, Headspace requests that individuals who have received coaching or clinical services at Headspace wait until their care with Headspace is complete before applying for a position. If someone with a Headspace account is hired for a position, please note their account will be deactivated and they will not be able to use Headspace services for the duration of their employment. 




Further, if Headspace cannot find a role that fails to resolve an ethical issue associated with a dual relationship, Headspace may need to take steps to ensure ethical obligations are being adhered to, including a delayed start date or a potential leave of absence. Such steps would be taken to protect both the former member, as well as any relevant individuals from their care team, from impairment, risk of exploitation, or harm.

If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.

4297632288,"Software Engineer, Teamwork",Notion,,,"San Francisco, CA","About Us

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Teamwork's mission is to make Notion the best collaborative environment for knowledge work. To that end, our ambitious goal is to transform Notion into the first of its kind—a shared experience where teams, people, and AI create their life's work, together. Our team focuses on improving our users' most frequent interactions within the Notion app: navigating their workspace, discovering relevant information, and working together effectively. We maintain and iterate on key building blocks of the collaboration experience, including the sidebar, inbox, notification and digest emails, comments, home page, and more.

We are at a unique and exciting turning point in Notion's journey, with two foundational shifts in customer needs. On one hand, we are witnessing unprecedented growth in the scale and complexity of our users' content and collaboration requirements. On the other, we are reimagining from the ground up our users' workflows in the AI era. To address these challenges, we are taking a step back to rethink Notion's core information architecture and develop a new foundation that will support our users' needs for the next decade.

We are looking for passionate full stack product engineers to help us build this vision. In this role, you will directly contribute to core building blocks of Notion's user experience, and will be a key player in building a robust technical foundation that can scale to individual users and large organizations alike.

What You'll Achieve


You'll lead strategic projects that improve Notion’s core user experience. You will work with cross-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to develop a product and technical vision that makes software toolmaking intuitive and scalable for all. You will drive execution on the team to deliver high-quality features to our users.
You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more.
You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales elegantly across many dimensions.

Skills You'll Need To Bring


Proven track record of execution: You have 7+ years of engineering experience, including several years building world-class product experiences alongside a team of engineers.
Tech leadership experience: You have previously held positions where you were responsible for making key technical decisions, guiding a team through complex projects, and mentoring junior team members.
Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.

          <strong>About Us<br><br></strong>We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.<br><br>We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.<br><br>Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).<br><br><strong>About The Role<br><br></strong>Teamwork's mission is to make Notion the best collaborative environment for knowledge work.

To address these challenges, we are taking a step back to rethink Notion's core information architecture and develop a new foundation that will support our users' needs for the next decade.<br><br>We are looking for passionate full stack product engineers to help us build this vision.

4168110099,Fullstack Software Engineer,Hadrian,,,"Los Angeles, CA","Hadrian — Manufacturing the Future

Hadrian is building autonomous factories that help aerospace and defense companies manufacture rockets, satellites, jets, and ships up to 10x faster and up to 2x cheaper. By combining advanced software, robotics, and full-stack manufacturing, we are reinventing how America produces its most critical parts.

We recently raised $260 million dollar Series C to accelerate this mission. We are excited to be launching a new Factory in Mesa, Arizona, a 270,000 square foot facility that will create 350 new jobs immediately. We are opening a new headquarters to support thousands of future hires, launching Hadrian Maritime to serve naval production, and introducing a Factory-as-a-Service model that delivers complete systems instead of individual parts.

Hadrian works with startups, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, and major defense contractors across space, shipbuilding, and aviation to scale production, reduce costs, and accelerate delivery on mission-critical programs. We are backed by leading investors including Lux Capital, Founders Fund, and Andreessen Horowitz. Our fast-growing team is united by a shared mission to reindustrialize American manufacturing for the 21st century and beyond!

The Role

As a foundational member of our software engineering team, you'll work closely with our product, operations, data, and robotics teams to make Flow, our FactoryOS, the factory platform of the future.

Flow is composed of a variety of internal and external critical business applications. Internally, we build software that informs, augments, and replaces work that needs to be done in the factory — for example, taking a customer request for parts, analyzing the complexity and cost, load balancing the work based on factory capacity, and returning a dynamic price quote and delivery estimate. Externally, our software helps our customers interface with Hadrian and manage their supply chain in real time.

Note: You do not need to have aerospace, defense, or manufacturing experience to excel in this role

What You'll Do


Scope, architect, implement, and deploy critical applications that will drive revenue and make a positive impact in the world
Own a product vertical with the opportunity to build a team around yourself over time (if interested)
Work directly with our internal and external customers to drive our roadmap
Get to build alongside an incredible team of engineers, operators, and the best machinists/CAM programmers in the world
Be given autonomy and virtually unlimited room to grow


What We’re Looking For


Bias to action, take pride in your work, and care more about getting to the right solution than being right
Have tech-lead critical projects or initiatives
Have worked on large, complex codebases
Have extensive experience shipping modern, full-stack applications (our front-ends are React/Next/Typescript and back-ends are Go and Python)
Are product-minded and user-driven
Are excited to work in a fast-paced environment with high-stakes and quick iteration cycles
Are a previous or future founder — if you leave Hadrian to start a company we'll do everything to support you, including investing in you and introducing you to Hadrian's investors
Can work from our Los Angeles Factory (Torrance)


Compensation

For this role, the target salary range is $120,000 - $250,000 (actual range may vary based on experience).

This is the lowest to highest salary we reasonably and in good faith believe we would pay for this role at the time of this posting. We may ultimately pay more or less than the posted range, and the range may be modified in the future. An employee's pay position within the salary range will be based on several factors, including, but not limited to, relevant education, qualifications, certifications, experience, skills, geographic location, performance, and business or organizational needs.

Benefits


100% coverage of medical, dental, vision, and life insurance plans for employees
401k
Relocation stipend if you’re moving from outside of LA
Flexible vacation policy

4297551296,"Software Developer, Services",Slice,,,"New York, United States","Ilir Sela started Slice with the belief that local pizzerias deserve all of the advantages of major franchises without compromising their independence. Starting with his family’s pizzerias, we now empower over tens of thousands of restaurants with the technology, services, and collective power that owners need to better serve their digitally minded customers and build lasting businesses. We’re growing and adding more talent to help fulfil this valuable mission. That’s where you come in.

This position is open to applicants based in the US and located in an Eastern time zone.

The Challenge to Solve

How do mom-and-pop pizzerias survive and win in a world of big-budget pizza chains and third-party apps? This is the challenge you’ll help solve at Slice. Local pizzerias already outperform the big chains in offline sales, yet are outsold 20-to-1 online – a gap we’re determined to close. We operate at the intersection of high stakes and local community: our mission is to level the playing field for small businesses by providing them with the technology and capabilities that rival those of the biggest players. When a shop partners with Slice, our goal is that it feels “as if they’ve just hired 1,000 people” to support their business. As an engineer on our team, you’ll seek out bold, asymmetric opportunities to create these outsized impacts for our restaurant partners and the millions of customers they serve. It’s not just about writing code – it’s about writing the future of local pizza.

What You'll Do

As a Software Developer on our Services team, you will immerse yourself in our ambitious mission and take on a wide range of responsibilities to drive customer impact. Specifically, you will:


Build innovative features & services: Design, code, and launch new backend features that help our restaurant partners operate more efficiently and deliver exceptional, seamless experiences to their customers. Your work will directly enhance real-world interactions between shops and pizza lovers every day.
Identify game-changing opportunities: Constantly look for asymmetric opportunities where a small technical change can deliver disproportionate value. You’ll use your creativity and entrepreneurial mindset to find 10x solutions that delight users and give our partners an edge.
Own projects end-to-end: Take ownership of initiatives from concept through production. You’ll work closely with product, design, and other teams to define solutions, execute rapidly, and iterate based on feedback. When you see a problem, you don’t wait - you tackle it.
Use the best tools for the job: While our primary stack is Python (Flask), we embrace any technology that delivers value. You might rewrite a microservice from Go to Python, craft a script in Ruby, or leverage a new cloud service – whatever it takes to solve the task at hand in a scalable way.
Collaborate in a small, agile team: Work alongside a tight-knit team of 5 to 8 backend engineers (across the US, UK, and Europe) who are as passionate about the mission as you are. Together, you will review code, brainstorm ideas, and push each other to raise the bar while maintaining a fun, supportive atmosphere.
Ensure quality and performance at scale: Employ best practices in coding, testing, monitoring, and DevOps to ensure our services are reliable and performant. You build it, you own it - from writing unit tests to fine-tuning logging and alerting, you’ll make sure your code runs smoothly in production.


The Winning Recipe

We’re Looking For Bold, Founder-like Engineers Who Aren’t Afraid To Challenge The Status Quo And Build Products That Make a Real Difference. If You’re An Unconventional Thinker And a Highly Productive Doer, You’ll Feel Right At Home. The Ideal Candidate Has


Owner’s mindset: You think like a founder. You take initiative, own problems end-to-end, and move with urgency to deliver results. Obstacles energize you, and you thrive in a fast-paced, ambiguous startup environment where your decisions drive real impact.
Proven builder: You have solid experience crafting scalable backend systems in Python (Flask) and working with databases and cloud services. You’re comfortable diving into monitoring and logging tools to keep systems healthy. More importantly, you’re technology-agnostic – you quickly pick up new languages or frameworks (Go, Ruby, or whatever is needed) to solve problems effectively.
Remote-ready collaborator: You excel at working on a distributed team and communicating asynchronously. You’re comfortable collaborating with teammates across different time zones and backgrounds, and you know how to stay connected and communicative in a remote work setting.
Product & customer focus: You care deeply about the why behind your code. You can clearly express opinions on product direction and design, always keeping the end-customer and restaurant owner in mind. At the same time, you respect others’ perspectives and believe the best ideas can come from anywhere.
Innovative problem solver: You love finding creative solutions to hard problems. Words like “impossible” or “uncharted” fuel your curiosity. You seek out those asymmetric win scenarios and aren’t afraid to experiment, adapt, and iterate to achieve a better outcome for users.


If you’ve ever dreamed of building something big, scrappy, and impactful – and you have the skills to back it up – we want to meet you!

4298953089,"Full Stack Engineer, Connect",Meter,,,"San Francisco, CA","Meter builds the infrastructure modern businesses depend on to stay connected. Our product, Connect, helps companies source, compare, install and manage internet connectivity across thousands of locations. We turn what is usually a painful process into one that is fast, transparent, and surprisingly simple.

We are hiring a Full Stack Engineer to drive the technical vision and development of the Connect platform. This role is not just about building features; it’s about solving complex problems at scale. Your work will improve customer experience, reduce friction, and enable Meter to scale to serve thousands of customers and tens of thousands of connections across the globe.

What Success Looks Like

You will build our Connect platform that empowers our customers to seamlessly manage their internet service provider connections from initial serviceability and quotation to support and billing and everything in between. More specifically, you’ll work to evaluate and integrate a variety of third party APIs, display abstract data in a seamless fashion for both customers and internal stakeholders, and build and develop automation to drive efficiency in a highly inefficient industry.

What Your Day-to-day Will Look Like

You’ll collaborate closely with our frontend, backend, and internal operations teammates to ship full-featured, production-grade systems that directly impact how businesses manage their connectivity. On the backend you will build in Go with Postgres, maintaining and extending our GraphQL API, and deploying on AWS and Azure. On the frontend, you will develop both customer-facing UIs and internal tools using React and TypeScript.

Who You Are

We are searching for someone who wants to do the most ambitious work of their career. You are a good fit if you are comfortable working across the stack, you thrive in an experimental environment where speed and quality matter a great deal, and you take ownership and drive technical decisions.

Why Meter?

The internet runs the world. Every purchase you make, video call you join, it's all packets flowing through networks. But those networks haven’t changed for decades. They’re brittle, complex, and surprisingly hard to set up in an enterprise space.

We started Meter to build better networks. We had to build everything from the ground-up: designing and building our own enterprise hardware, intuitive software, and streamlined operations to deliver great outcomes for our customers. Today, we build and deploy these networks at scale. Ambitious companies and enduring institutions like Bridgewater, Lyft, Reddit, rely on Meter to keep their thousands of employees and locations online and productive.

Our bet with Meter is simple: we will all use the internet more than we do today. We believe we have the definitive networking stack in place to enable business to do so as seamlessly and reliably as any modern utility.

Compensation


The estimated base salary for this role is between $170,000 - $220,000
Additionally, this role is eligible to participate in Meter's equity plan.

4298246412,Machine Learning Engineer,Nearmap,,,"Carlsbad, CA","The sky's not the limit at Nearmap



We’re a SaaS company, with proprietary hardware and software that’s continuously advancing through our commitment to innovation. The sky’s the limit when it comes to what we can and plan to do for our customers. Our imagery is just the starting point. Our impact comes from our people, applying complex analysis, interpretation and artificial intelligence that opens up all sorts of possibilities for our customers.





Job Description



The Insurance AI team conducts technical work to design, develop, and support products that use Nearmap and third-party data to derive insurance risk insights. While our data scientists focus on modeling and analysis, the Machine Learning Engineer ensures they have the robust, scalable, and efficient tools, pipelines, and development environments they need to deliver.



In this role, you will:



Act as the Insurance AI team’s champion for code and tool reuse (python), ensuring models move smoothly from concept to reliable operation in production, and helping the team leverage “Nearmap scale” data effectively to build and deploy the best models.
Design and build data and model pipelines that enable the full lifecycle of model development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.
Adapt, extend, and productionize tooling from the broader AI & Computer Vision (AICV) team in Sydney to meet the specific needs of the Insurance AI team.
Operate within cloud-based infrastructure, making use of internal and external APIs, bucket storage, databases, cloud compute and other technologies to integrate data, models, and workflows into scalable production systems.
Ensure our infrastructure and processes support experimentation at speed while maintaining high standards for reliability, security, and scalability.

While prior experience in insurance or deep learning on aerial imagery is not required, familiarity in these areas will be considered a plus.



Key Responsibilities:



ML Engineering & Infrastructure Development
Contribute to ML pipelines on cloud native technologies for data ingestion, feature processing, model training, deployment, and monitoring in AWS.
Support internal tools and frameworks to streamline experimentation, ensure reproducibility, and improve delivery speed.

2. API Integration & Tooling Adaptation



Develop, consume, and integrate both internal and external APIs to connect datasets, models, and services in collaboration with other engineers.
Adapt and extend core tooling from the AI & Computer Vision team for Insurance AI’s specific use cases.
Bridge the gap between research prototypes and production-grade systems.

3. Collaboration & Technical Leadership



Serve as a trusted technical partner to data scientists, enabling them to execute modeling projects efficiently and at scale.

2+ years of experience as a Machine Learning Engineer, ML-focused Software Engineer, or equivalent, with a proven record of delivering production-grade ML systems.
Bachelors degree in math, computer science or other related technical field.
Experience integrating and adapting existing ML tools to new domains or use cases.

Mandatory:



Python-based Machine Learning: Using a range of python packages for ML pipeline development and deployment (such as sklearn, pandas, PyTorch).
Software Development: ability to code in Python, with strong skills in writing clean, maintainable, well tested and efficient code, working with other engineers on a shared codebase. You will need to make use of a range of python packages built by other teams, and work collaboratively through feature branch and pull request reviews.
Data Engineering: Proficiency with SQL and experience building scalable data processing workflows (e.g., Apache Spark, Airflow, dbt).
Collaboration: Strong communication skills and ability to translate technical solutions into actionable steps for non-engineers (working with a range of Data Scientists, ML Engineers and ML Ops engineers)

About Wealthfront




Here at Wealthfront, our mission is to create a financial system that favors people, not institutions. We do this by leveraging technology to build powerful, low-cost, and easy-to-use financial products that help modern investors grow and manage their money.




We started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business. By automating strategies typically reserved for the wealthy, we unlocked access to high quality investment advice for a digitally-native generation that was underserved by traditional institutions. Since then, we've expanded to a full suite of products designed to help our clients turn their savings into long-term wealth, including:




• A Cash Account that, through our partner banks, offers one of the highest annual percentage yields on uninvested cash in the industry, while providing instant and secure access to your money with no account fees and a full suite of checking features.




• A zero-commission Stock Investing Account with 50+ handpicked collections that help DIY investors discover new companies and make smarter investing decisions.




• Multiple automated investing portfolios designed to unlock tax savings through sophisticated strategies like fixed income, tax-loss harvesting, and direct indexing—which we offer at industry-leading low costs and accessible minimums.




Our award-winning products have attracted over 1 million clients who trust us with more than $85 billion of their hard earned savings—and we're far from done. If you’re inspired to help us reshape the financial industry as we create our next chapter, let’s talk!

Message to applicants applying to work in the U.S. and/or Canada:

When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. and/or Canada locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.

U.S. employees haveaccess (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/careers/we-are-cisco/benefits-and-perks.html) to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings.

Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday (for non-exempt employees), plus a day off for their birthday. Non-Exempt new hires accrue up to 16 days of vacation time off each year, at a rate of 4.92 hours per pay period. Exempt new hires participate in Cisco’s flexible Vacation Time Off policy, which does not place a defined limit on how much vacation time eligible employees may use, but is subject to availability and some business limitations. All new hires are eligible for Sick Time Off subject to Cisco’s Sick Time Off Policy and will have eighty (80) hours of sick time off provided on their hire date and on January 1st of each year thereafter. Up to 80 hours of unused sick time will be carried forward from one calendar year to the next such that the maximum number of sick time hours an employee may have available is 160 hours. Employees in Illinois have a unique time off program designed specifically with local requirements in mind. All employees also have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.

Employees On Sales Plans Earn Performance-based Incentive Pay On Top Of Their Base Salary, Which Is Split Between Quota And Non-quota Components. For Quota-based Incentive Pay, Cisco Typically Pays As Follows


75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;


1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;

1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.

For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.

About Wealthfront Engineering

Wealthfront’s culture centers around continuous learning, innovation, and quality-driven software development. With high quality software as our ultimate engineering objective, our key tactic is automation:




• Wealthfront software automates the financial services we provide to our clients, and within these services we automate the collection of data that we learn from on our way to making our services even better.




• Wealthfront engineers function as builder/operators, with dual responsibility for building the system and operating it in production. Any toil that this brings about is automated away by engineers. This investment in automation is expected, and the prioritization of it is always built into our planning and execution.




• Wealthfront engineers automate our development processes. For example, Wealthfront engineers automate all of our testing. Manual testing is not part of the software development lifecycle at Wealthfront.




• Wealthfront engineers automate observability in case of failure. If something is up, our systems inform engineers appropriately. If our systems are quiet, they are healthy.




If you are drawn to being an engineer within such an environment, and having outsized impact as an engineer at a magnitude that is only available within a company achieving greatness at our size (~250 employees, half in engineering), then we want to hear from you! 










About the Role
We are looking for backend engineers to join our core product development teams. You’ll work with other engineers to design and build new features or enhance existing features. This work will add capabilities to the various backend systems and services that support Wealthfront’s products, and will be done with automated instrumentation and monitoring to require minimal operational maintenance.
You’ll help improve the maintainability and stability of our codebase by fixing issues and adding necessary enhancements to our existing backend systems. You’ll ensure that mission critical backend systems and services operate smoothly in production by triaging and resolving operational issues as part of a team of on-call engineers. You’ll proactively identify opportunities for improving the reliability and scalability of our systems.
Additionally, you might play a part in evolving the engineering organization by participating in recruiting activities such as interviewing and attending career fairs and providing mentorship to other engineers on the team.




About You
You have 2-6 years of experience in developing backend components, services or APIs in Java or a similar language. You demonstrate knowledge and understanding of distributed systems and functional programming paradigms. You have knowledge of SQL and experience working with online data stores (ideally something like MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server but NoSQL is okay).
You have passion for agile, test-driven development, continuous integration and automated testing. You also have a passion for working on platforms and backend systems that have measurable business impact and like working in a fast paced cross functional environment.
While not required, experience working with Spark pipelines is a plus along with knowledge of an ORM technology such as Hibernate.  Another plus is working with a dependency injection framework (one of Guice, Spring, Pico, Dagger).
You have either a BS or MS in computer science or related field.




Once you join, Wealthfront will:
Pair you with a mentor who will guide you through our structured onboarding program
Encourage you to work on projects that match your professional goals
Support your professional development by providing feedback during weekly 1:1s and our semi-annual reviews
Provide you autonomy so you can be a happy and successful member of our team







Estimated annual salary range: $140,000 - $185,000 USD plus equity and a discretionary bonus.




Benefits include medical, vision, dental, 401K plan, generous time off, parental leave, wellness reimbursements, professional development, employee investing discount, and more!




About Wealthfront




Here at Wealthfront, our mission is to create a financial system that favors people, not institutions. We do this by leveraging technology to build powerful, low-cost, and easy-to-use financial products that help modern investors grow and manage their money.




We started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business. By automating strategies typically reserved for the wealthy, we unlocked access to high quality investment advice for a digitally-native generation that was underserved by traditional institutions. Since then, we've expanded to a full suite of products designed to help our clients turn their savings into long-term wealth, including:




• A Cash Account that, through our partner banks, offers one of the highest annual percentage yields on uninvested cash in the industry, while providing instant and secure access to your money with no account fees and a full suite of checking features.




• A zero-commission Stock Investing Account with 50+ handpicked collections that help DIY investors discover new companies and make smarter investing decisions.




• Multiple automated investing portfolios designed to unlock tax savings through sophisticated strategies like fixed income, tax-loss harvesting, and direct indexing—which we offer at industry-leading low costs and accessible minimums.




Our award-winning products have attracted over 1 million clients who trust us with more than $85 billion of their hard earned savings—and we're far from done. If you’re inspired to help us reshape the financial industry as we create our next chapter, let’s talk!

Disclosures: All investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Tax-Loss Harvesting benefits vary depending on the client's entire tax and investment profile.

4298810229,Software Engineer,Scalekit,,,"San Francisco, CA","About Scalekit

Scalekit is building the authentication stack for AI applications. We started by solving enterprise-grade auth for B2B SaaS - features like SSO, SCIM provisioning, multi-tenant orgs, and admin portals. Now, as AI adoption accelerates, authentication has to work not just for human users but also for AI agents.

Inbound auth for MCP servers using OAuth 2.1, PKCE, and dynamic client registration.
Outbound actions for AI agents through token vaults and scoped access to third-party apps.




We’re backed by top investors and a strong network of engineering leaders. At Scalekit, we focus on solving hard authentication problems while obsessing over delivering great developer experiences.




Why This Role Matters

We’re looking for a Software Developer (1-3 years of experience) to join our focused, high-impact team in San Francisco. You’ll work directly with the founders and core engineers to:

Build reference apps, integrations, and proofs-of-concept
Create examples and quickstarts that make Scalekit simple and intuitive for other developers
Bring real-world developer feedback into our product and docs.

This is a unique opportunity to learn fast, ship quickly, and directly shape how developers adopt authentication in AI-driven products.




What you’ll do

1) Build reference apps and POCs

Create small, runnable projects in Python, Node.js, and Next.js that demonstrate key auth flows (SSO, passwordless logins, agent auth, and MCP integration).
Publish quickstart repos, snippets, and scripts that other developers can copy and adapt.




2) Help with real integrations

Work alongside the team and customers during pilots to reproduce and fix issues.
Patch small utilities or examples that reduce friction, and document what you learned.




3) Feed learnings back into the product

Spot recurring issues and suggest SDK improvements or validation checks.
Share feedback with the core team on how onboarding and workflows could be smoother.




4) Engage with the developer ecosystem

Attend local developer events to hear what problems others face and bring insights back to the team
Participate in GitHub discussions when you can contribute code or fixes.




Challenges You’ll Help Solve

Make it simple for developers to plug Scalekit auth into their SaaS and AI apps
Create “aha!” moments - shorten the path from first test to production.
Build reusable code and examples that other developers trust and love.




What we’re looking for

Builder at heart: You explore new SDKs, APIs, and stacks, figure things out quickly, and enjoy experimenting
Hands-on coder: Proficient in at least one of Python, Node.js, or Next.js, with the ability to learn from others as needed
Empathy for developers: You care about the small details that make (or break) a great developer experience, from error messages to onboarding guides
Self-starter: You take open-ended problems, build proofs-of-concept, and ship usable solutions
Collaborative Style: You’re excited to explain your solutions, write clean GitHub repos, and contribute to the developer community
Comfort with startup pace: adaptable, willing to wear multiple hats, and thrive in an environment where priorities can shift




Bonus if you have

Exposure to authentication/identity protocols (OAuth, OIDC, SAML, SCIM)
Experience with IdPs like Okta, Entra ID, or Google
Familiarity with cloud platforms (GCP or AWS)
Prior startup or open-source contributions.




Why you’ll love working here

Work side-by-side with the founders, shipping production-ready code from day one
Directly shape how authentication works for the next wave of AI and SaaS applications
Join a team that values curiosity, speed, and craftsmanship and where your contributions have immediate impact
Backed by top investors and advisors in AI and infrastructure.




Interested? Send us a note at founders@scalekit.com with links to repos, projects, or hacks you’ve built. We care about showing you can figure things out and ship code.

About Wealthfront Engineering

Wealthfront’s culture centers around continuous learning, innovation, and quality-driven software development. With high quality software as our ultimate engineering objective, our key tactic is automation:




• Wealthfront software automates the financial services we provide to our clients, and within these services we automate the collection of data that we learn from on our way to making our services even better.




• Wealthfront engineers function as builder/operators, with dual responsibility for building the system and operating it in production. Any toil that this brings about is automated away by engineers. This investment in automation is expected, and the prioritization of it is always built into our planning and execution.




• Wealthfront engineers automate our development processes. For example, Wealthfront engineers automate all of our testing. Manual testing is not part of the software development lifecycle at Wealthfront.




• Wealthfront engineers automate observability in case of failure. If something is up, our systems inform engineers appropriately. If our systems are quiet, they are healthy.




If you are drawn to being an engineer within such an environment, and having outsized impact as an engineer at a magnitude that is only available within a company achieving greatness at our size (~250 employees, half in engineering), then we want to hear from you! 










About the Role
We are looking for backend engineers to join our core product development teams. You’ll work with other engineers to design and build new features or enhance existing features. This work will add capabilities to the various backend systems and services that support Wealthfront’s products, and will be done with automated instrumentation and monitoring to require minimal operational maintenance.
You’ll help improve the maintainability and stability of our codebase by fixing issues and adding necessary enhancements to our existing backend systems. You’ll ensure that mission critical backend systems and services operate smoothly in production by triaging and resolving operational issues as part of a team of on-call engineers. You’ll proactively identify opportunities for improving the reliability and scalability of our systems.
Additionally, you might play a part in evolving the engineering organization by participating in recruiting activities such as interviewing and attending career fairs and providing mentorship to other engineers on the team.




About You
You have 2-6 years of experience in developing backend components, services or APIs in Java or a similar language. You demonstrate knowledge and understanding of distributed systems and functional programming paradigms. You have knowledge of SQL and experience working with online data stores (ideally something like MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server but NoSQL is okay).
You have passion for agile, test-driven development, continuous integration and automated testing. You also have a passion for working on platforms and backend systems that have measurable business impact and like working in a fast paced cross functional environment.
While not required, experience working with Spark pipelines is a plus along with knowledge of an ORM technology such as Hibernate.  Another plus is working with a dependency injection framework (one of Guice, Spring, Pico, Dagger).
You have either a BS or MS in computer science or related field.




Once you join, Wealthfront will:
Pair you with a mentor who will guide you through our structured onboarding program
Encourage you to work on projects that match your professional goals
Support your professional development by providing feedback during weekly 1:1s and our semi-annual reviews
Provide you autonomy so you can be a happy and successful member of our team







Estimated annual salary range: $140,000 - $185,000 USD plus equity and a discretionary bonus.




Benefits include medical, vision, dental, 401K plan, generous time off, parental leave, wellness reimbursements, professional development, employee investing discount, and more!




About Wealthfront

• A Cash Account that, through our partner banks, offers one of the highest annual percentage yields on uninvested cash in the industry, while providing instant and secure access to your money with no account fees and a full suite of checking features.




• A zero-commission Stock Investing Account with 50+ handpicked collections that help DIY investors discover new companies and make smarter investing decisions.




• Multiple automated investing portfolios designed to unlock tax savings through sophisticated strategies like fixed income, tax-loss harvesting, and direct indexing—which we offer at industry-leading low costs and accessible minimums.




Our award-winning products have attracted over 1 million clients who trust us with more than $85 billion of their hard earned savings—and we're far from done. If you’re inspired to help us reshape the financial industry as we create our next chapter, let’s talk!

Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.

The Institutional product group enables the foundations of Coinbase's institutional business supporting thousands of large financial institutions.

Staking is an integral part of the Custody experience because it allows customers to earn a yield on their digital assets. The Institutional Staking Engineering team also plays an important role in helping to secure underlying blockchain networks by unlocking billions of dollars worth of assets for staking that would otherwise remain unstaked on the sideline. These additional funds contribute to security of networks by increasing the costs of 51% attacks and increasing the diversity and decentralization of validators.




What you'll be doing:





Articulate a long term vision for maintaining and scaling our backend systems.


Work with engineers, designers, product managers and senior leadership to turn our product and technical vision into a tangible roadmap every quarter.


Write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers

You have experience with Blockchains (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc..)


You have experience decomposing a large monolith into microservices.

Must be a self-starter, often figuring things out that you have never done before, and maybe no one has done before
Desire to work in a cross-functional team (product/design/eng)
Experience with React is a plus, but not required... we will support you in learning it as long as you are eager to dive in.
Must be an AI-first minded developer, both in the tools you use, and desire to integrate it into the product

4297670817,Backend Engineer,Zip Security,,,United States,"Company

Enterprise cybersecurity is broken. Current annual cybersecurity spending is roughly $150B, with most enterprises spending heavily to deploy, manage, and configure 100s of different tools for marginal security benefit. At Zip, our goal is to build software that makes enterprise cybersecurity reasonable – to reduce bloat by bundling and configuring opinionated security tooling, synchronizing everything from device management to application security under one central pane of glass.

Multiple companies with security offerings from Google to Jamf are now releasing APIs that allow automated management, and with new government efforts to publish data on the global security risk landscape, there’s a unique opportunity to be the first in the market to properly integrate and build a full-stack, opinionated, enterprise security company. At Zip, you’ll be at the cutting edge of security, working with some of the world’s most important companies to effortlessly secure their people, software, and data.

Our Values


We want our employees learn, grow, and have career satisfaction
We want to create a successful company – but not at the cost of culture. At Zip, we value each other, and want to create a culture where our people are not only “working in a fast-paced, challenging, environment” but are also (and more importantly) happy, learning, and able to contribute. We value succeeding as a collective.
We are a high autonomy, high trust organization that prioritizes thoughtful communication
No one likes being micromanaged. At Zip, we value autonomy and trust our employees to get the job done. We add communication here to emphasize that high autonomy and high trust doesn’t mean no support. At Zip supporting our employees and creating a great culture is a top priority. Thoughtful communication in tandem with high ownership is key to not just building a successful culture, but also external collaboration with customers and internal teams.


We value transparency, equity, and empathy.
Honest, empathetic feedback is kind. It gives your co-workers the opportunity to grow and become the best versions of themselves. At Zip, we value frequent, well-structured, fair feedback – feedback that directly relates activities to outcomes, and allows us all to move forward together, better.
We want to move fast, be flexible, but not break things:
We’re a start-up: we need to move fast, and be able to pivot at a moment’s notice. But we don’t want to break things, and want to balance being fast with being thoughtful and intentional about how we build our software.
We value balance
Whether it’s work/life balance or moving fast/building right balance, understanding the tradeoffs in a start-up and making sure to strike the right balance is necessary. We continuously evaluate our decisions in a data-driven way, and aim to make sure we’re always getting better.
We assume best intentions
We're a team working together to make enterprise cybersecurity easy. We'll face hard problems together, and assuming best intentions of coworkers is of utmost importance to building a great culture.
The Role

As a Founding Backend Engineer, you'll help build from the ground up, designing and implementing secure APIs that harmonize functionality across multiple different enterprise software providers. You'll build a first-class, multi-tenant, cloud-native product and gain experience with everything from optimizing database queries to constructing secure login. You'll gain experience with:


AWS services (RDS, ECS, Fargate, etc.)
Infrastructure as code (Pulumi, Typescript)
Docker
Rust
Auth0, HashiCorp Vault
Common enterprise security tooling (Jamf/Okta/GSuite/Microsoft Intune/Crowdstrike etc.)


Requirements

Overall, we’re looking for software engineers with high-ownership, autonomy, and willingness to learn.

Preferred requirements are flexible, but are loosely:


Familiarity with AWS services
2+ years of experience as a software engineer
Willingness to learn new things
An interest in security
Startup experience

4285833475,Frontend Software Engineer,Hadrian,,,"Los Angeles, CA","Hadrian - Manufacturing the Future

Hadrian is building autonomous factories that help aerospace and defense companies manufacture rockets, satellites, jets, and ships up to 10x faster and up to 2x cheaper. By combining advanced software, robotics, and full-stack manufacturing, we are reinventing how America produces its most critical parts.

We recently raised $260 million dollar Series C to accelerate this mission. We are excited to be launching a new Factory in Mesa, Arizona, a 270,000 square foot facility that will create 350 new jobs immediately. We are opening a new headquarters to support thousands of future hires, launching Hadrian Maritime to serve naval production, and introducing a Factory-as-a-Service model that delivers complete systems instead of individual parts.

Hadrian works with startups, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, and major defense contractors across space, shipbuilding, and aviation to scale production, reduce costs, and accelerate delivery on mission-critical programs. We are backed by leading investors including Lux Capital, Founders Fund, and Andreessen Horowitz. Our fast-growing team is united by a shared mission to reindustrialize American manufacturing for the 21st century and beyond!

The Role

Candidates for this role could end up working with a number of our internal products and teams:

Flow is Hadrian’s FactoryOS, our core platform comprised of a variety of applications that model, manage, and automate an extremely complex network of factories.

Copilot is our suite of manufacturing automation products which automates or accelerates key processes within the factory including quoting, CAM programming, and CMM programming.

Factory Automation develops robotic cells for use in our factories and the software that controls them.

We have a broad set of applications internally. Candidates interested in redefining manufacturing software will have ample opportunity to do so.

What You’ll Do


Scope, architect, implement, and deploy critical applications across multiple product verticals.
Engage in product discovery alongside experts in manufacturing and software- help define what needs to exist and what needs to be better.
Build alongside an incredible team of engineers and operators.


What We’re Looking For


Expert in TypeScript and frontend web development, ideally using React and related state management solutions. Deep understanding of the frontend ecosystem.
Strong ability and desire to write high quality code and maintain a high quality codebase.
API design experience (REST & gRPC).
Know how to develop, deploy, and maintain fullstack applications using a modern web stack.
Bias towards action and take pride in your work.
Excited to work in a fast-paced environment with high-stakes and quick iteration cycles.


What Will Set You Apart


Have great product intuition and user empathy. You enjoy talking to users.
Have a strong sense of design and execute at a high level with or without design support.
Comfortable jumping into different areas of our stack as needed: Go, Python, C#, C++, etc.
Have experience with data visualization, video games, CAD/CAM software, or 3D environments.
Have demonstrated success with developing and deploying high performance web applications.


Compensation

For this role, the target salary range is $120,000 - $250,000 (actual range may vary based on experience).

This is the lowest to highest salary we reasonably and in good faith believe we would pay for this role at the time of this posting. We may ultimately pay more or less than the posted range, and the range may be modified in the future. An employee's pay position within the salary range will be based on several factors, including, but not limited to, relevant education, qualifications, certifications, experience, skills, geographic location, performance, and business or organizational needs.

75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;


1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;

1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.

Location Type: Remote

Department Engineering

Overview

We’re not just building better tech. We’re rewriting how data moves and what the world can do with it. With Confluent, data doesn’t sit still. Our platform puts information in motion, streaming in near real-time so companies can react faster, build smarter, and deliver experiences as dynamic as the world around them.

It takes a certain kind of person to join this team. Those who ask hard questions, give honest feedback, and show up for each other. No egos, no solo acts. Just smart, curious humans pushing toward something bigger, together.

One Confluent. One Team. One Data Streaming Platform.

About The Role

Based on Apache Kafka, the Confluent Cloud Platform is the leading Cloud Native Platform as a Service for streaming data infrastructure, but this is just the beginning. We are building a PaaS that will enable customers around the globe to deliver streaming applications.

What You Will Do


Design, implement and maintain Golang infrastructure services (typically implemented as Kubernetes operators) to deliver the Confluent cloud foundations to the broader engineering organisation
Kubernetes, Terraform, Datadog, Prometheus and a strong command of Linux, public cloud and networking should come as standard - though Golang software engineering will be your primary focus
As a Confluent Cloud Infrastructure Software Engineer, you will be working alongside the rest of the Confluent engineers to build our PaaS product
You and the rest of the team will be responsible for the provisioning, availability, performance, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning of the Confluent cloud
If you love the hum of big data systems covering 10,000's of instances spread across 1000’s of Kubernetes clusters in multiple cloud providers and thinking about how to make them run as smoothly and securely as possible, and want to have a significant influence on the architecture plus operational design points of this new product, then you will fit right in.
Please know this is a remote role, but you must be based in Poland.


What You Will Bring


Bsc, Msc, or PhD in computer science or a related field, or equivalent work experience
Strong fundamentals in distributed systems design and development
Good understanding of the Kubernetes ecosystem
Knowledge in building and operating large-scale systems
Understanding of basic system operations (disk, network, operating systems, etc)
A self-starter with the ability to work effectively in teams
Proficiency in Go, Python, C++, or other statically typed languages
Experience/knowledge with public clouds (AWS, Azure or GCP)


What Gives You An Edge


Experience with Golang and a Kubernetes CNI is advantageous
Experience using Kubernetes is a big plus
Relevant cloud infrastructure/cloud networking experience


Ready to build what's next? Let’s get in motion.

Come As You Are

Belonging isn’t a perk here. It’s the baseline. We work across time zones and backgrounds, knowing the best ideas come from different perspectives. And we make space for everyone to lead, grow, and challenge what’s possible.

We’re proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. Employment decisions are based on job-related criteria, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status, or any other classification protected by law.

We value curiosity, collaboration, and impact above rigid requirements. If you're excited about AI and automation, thrive in flexible, creative environments, and want to work on meaningful, pioneering projects - this role is for you.

We encourage anyone to apply - we think talent, passion and your unique perspective can outweigh years of experience. We are really looking for someone who can hit the ground running on day one and contribute at a rapid pace, while also being someone from whom we ourselves can learn from.

The Role

Collaborate with our forward deploy team to understand how customers interact with Automat’s platform today, and use those learnings to bolster our flagship workflow management product.
Build interfaces that use cutting-edge computer use models in real world applications.
Develop beautiful and intuitive UX interfaces which abstract away complex business automation processes and create a seamless experience for non-technical users and engineers alike
Influence our engineering practices, shape product direction, and contribute to building a world class company culture.


What Drives You


Curiosity, creativity, and a relentless desire to learn and adapt to changing technologies
Working in fast-moving, collaborative teams made up of engineers with diverse backgrounds
Excitement about the power of rapidly developing with AI tools, with a healthy skepticism for their veracity
Turning highly sophisticated and technical systems into intuitive, delightful, human-friendly applications


What’s In Your Toolbox


Hacker mindset - you know when to ship out functional v0 by any means necessary
Experience building with modern web frameworks (Next.js, Svelte kit, React) and extensive experience working with REST APIs
Robust background building complex architectures from the ground up, ranging from hacked together prototypes to scalable enterprise solutions.
Experience using AI tools effectively (e.g. Cursor, Windsurf, lovable, etc.)


What we are looking for


Top notch communication and collaboration skills
Comfort navigating ambiguity and wearing multiple hats
Passion for creating intuitive, user-friendly experiences
Proactive mindset and high initiative, with a bias toward action
An intrinsic desire to leave things better than you found them
Experience as an IC in startups or other dynamic, high-growth setting


Compensation Range: $175K - $220K
